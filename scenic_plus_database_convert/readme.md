## Conversion of Motif Database

Scenic+ provide a useful motif database for some other gene regulation network like dictys to use, but we do nned to calculate the threshold and convert it into .motif format. 

I implemented those scrips to help us convert the motif database in secnic+ and calculate the thrshold to let it could be use in dictys. 

Here is the more information for those two packages.
